# About "Workday Planner"

## Background

The fifth homework assignment entails creating a day calendar specifically for work hours.  Users will open the calnder application, click on an hour block and be able to enter text describing a task or a reminder.  After clicking the "Save" icon the text will be saved (local storage) so that it may be retrieved later.  Each row represents an hour and each row will be color-coded to correspond with the status of completion of the task in that hour.  

### Requirements
